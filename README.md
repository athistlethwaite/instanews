# Instanews Project

This project utilizes the New York Times API to populate each section with stories. In doing so, it pulls the image, the url, and the abstract from the NYT API and is displayed clearly, on my page. While building this site, it was built to be responsive by implementing a mobile first design, and then adding in media queries to be responsive for tablet and desktop.

## Skills Learned:

- Javascript
- Json
- Ajax
- jQuery
- Sass
- Gulp
- CSCC
- & more

## Outcomes:

This project has helped to deepen my knowledge of HTML and CSS elements. It gave me insight into gulp, Ajax request, jQuery, and how to organize my CSS through Sass.

I realize I still have questions around Javascript. Hopefully with reviewing this project I can take your feedback and polish off this assignment during our portfolio work week.
