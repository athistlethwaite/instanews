# Instanews Project

The purpose of this project was to create an 'Instanews App'. This project utilizes the New York Times API to populate each section with stories. In doing so it pulls the image, the url, and the abstract from the NYT API and is displayed clearly, on my page. While building this site, it was built to be responsive by implementing a mobile first design, and then adding in media queries to be responsive for tablet and desktop.
